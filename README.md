# Tabëla
Tabëla is a very simple GNOME app that formats tables coming from spreadsheets or
CSV/TSV files into HTML or Markdown.

Input can be any text separated by TAB, commas or semicolon and it can
output the table formatted for Markdown (and ASCII art) or plain HTML.

# Usage

![Example image of Tabela's UI](https://github.com/xanathar/tabela/blob/assets/screenshots/TabToMd.png)

Just copy from your spreadsheet of choice into the top area. Markdown or HTML will appear in the bottom.
Select and Ctrl+C to copy the result.

# FAQ

> Why did you write this program?

I wish I didn't have to format tables so many times, to paste it on Slack, on Jira tickets, on wikis, or
wherever.

> What does Tabëla mean?

"Tabëla" means "table" (as in 'spreadsheet table', not 'the surface where you place dishes' table) in
[Piedmontese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmontese_language). I'm from the Piedmont region of Italy,
my grandma spoke mainly Piedmontese, as do my in-laws when they talk to each other and many other relatives.
It's a dying language/dialect and is mostly used out of tech. I love using it in a tech context as a homage.
Plus, it's a little funny thing to do.

> Your icon sucks

I suck at art. My best drawing pales compared to a stick figure drawn by a 3 years old. Feel free to contribute
an icon.

> The icon does not respect GNOME design guidelines
